# To-Do List

A to-do list app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add, check and uncheck, and delete tasks, which are saved automatically in the browser using local storage. The layout adapts to different screen sizes.

## What I Reinforced

- Handling user interactions and DOM manipulation using JavaScript.
- Saving and retrieving data with `localStorage` to persist user tasks.
- Responsive design with media queries and backdrop filters.
